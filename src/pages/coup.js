<h1>Role summary</h1>


<p> During my time here I was a member of the team responsible for the ride. Our overall objective was to make sure that user experience was as seamless as possible for any customers interacting with the scooters. High on our list was to make sure that any scooter which were available to rent performed flawlessly or if any problems arose customers were easily able to rectify these.

<h2>Case study - Customer reporting</h2>

<p className='ma0'> Problem statments</p>

<Example
title='Unusable scooters '
text='Eighteen helmets are stolen every day on average, when stolen scooter is out of commission until itâ€™s replaced. The operations team only finds out that the helmet is missing when reported by the CS team.'
help='By reducing the time to replace the helmet gives us a lower potential lost of earning as the scooter remains out of commission for less time.'

<Example
title='Cancellation cause unknown '
text='12% of rides are cancelled before a customer starts the engine, there are a number of hypotheses as to the casue.
zb. Damage, Low battery, Missing helmet, wrong scooter selected.'
help='By gathering data the aim is to address the cancellation rate and reduce this in the future.'

<Example
title='Damage invoicing'
text='If a scooter damaged it can be difficult to determine the casue and charge the correct customer especially if the scoter has had muliple riders.'
help='Not all customers report a problem making the potential chain of rides longer and harder to track. By reducing the potential number of rentals we aim it to make the identification eaiser.'

<h2 className='mt5'>Solutions reporting</h2>

<p>
If a customer cancels a ride without starting the engine the dismissible popup is displayed. It helps to gather data about issues faced during the ride process as well as highlighting any problems quickly to the operation team.
